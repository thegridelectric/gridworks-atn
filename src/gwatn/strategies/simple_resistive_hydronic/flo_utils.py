def get_max_energy_kwh(params: FloParamsSimpleresistivehydronic) -> float:
    """
    Calculates the maximum usable energy stored in the water tanks for a heating system modeled using
    the Simple Resistive Hydronic AtomicTNode strategy.

    This model assumes idealized stratification, where the water is in a single cylindrical tank
    and has two temperatures: a high temperature, `params.MaxStoreTempF`, and a low temperature,
    which is the return water temp (RWT) from the distribution system. There is a totally
    horizontal thermocline; that is, above a certain height in the tank all water is the max
    temp, and below that height all water is the return water temp.

    The state of maximum energy in the tank is when the entire tank is at the highest temperature.
    However, determining the amount of energy in kilowatt-hours (kWh) requires establishing a baseline
    energy level. In this calculation, the assumption is made that the baseline energy is the amount
    of energy the tank would contain if it were uniformly at the return water temp. This choice
    provides a reasonable approximation for the "zero energy" reference in this model.

    This model of a water tank heated by resistive elements is highly idealized.

    Args:
        params (FloParamsSimpleresistivehydronic): The parameters of the heating system. Specifically,
        it uses these attributes of a FloParamsSimpleresistivehydronic object:
        - StoreSizeGallons
        - MaxStoreTempF
        - RequiredSourceWaterTempF
        - ReturnWaterDeltaTempF
        This function can also be used with objects that can be duck-typed as `AtnParams`.

        float: The maximum usable energy stored in kilowatt-hours (kWh) in the water tanks.

    """
    Returns the loss of energy from the tank for a time slice due to radiating through the tank insulation.

    as a function of the starting node. This energy is assumed to not contribute to warming the relevant
    thermal envelope of the house (assuming the water tanks are in the basement, it may indeed be
    overly optimistic to assume heat radiated into the basement will make it into the living space).

    A more accurate variant would provide passive loss as a function of an edge. However, given how small
    this loss typically is, this simplification is pretty insignificant compared to other inaccuracies
    of the model and we didn't think it was worth the additional complexity.

        ts_idx: The Time Slice Index. This is used to get the duration of the time slice,
        which may vary (for example, one might choose 5 minute intervals for the first
        several time slices)

        store_idx: Used to calculate how much of the tank is at MaxStoreTempF, and
        how much is at ReturnWaterTempF.

) -> float:
    """
    Calculates the maximum heat output attainable by a heating system  modeled using
    the Simple Resistive Hydronic AtomicTNode strategy.

    This calculation takes into account the parameters of the system, including the gallons per minute
    (gpm) of the circulator pump for the single-zone distribution system and the difference
    (delta_temp_f) between the source/supply water temperature (SWT) entering the distribution system
    and the return water temperature (RWT) coming back from the distribution system.

    Please note that this model assumes a constant speed for the circulator pump and a fixed temperature delta.
    It provides a reasonable estimate for understanding the mechanics of single-zone homes, but may not accurately
    model multi-zone homes or address all potential issues.

    Finally, note that this is not the same as the amount of heat that a house requires on the coldest
    day of a Typical Modeled Year.
