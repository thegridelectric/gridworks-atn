GridWorks AtomicTNode SDK
=========

This is the `GridWorks <https://gridworks.readthedocs.io/>`_ Python SDK for building Atomic Transactive Nodes, or
`AtomicTNodes <https://gridworks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/atomic-t-node.html>`_.

AtomicTNodes are a flavor of `GNodes <https://gridworks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/g-node.html>`_ ("G" for Grid) -
perhaps the most fun and interesting to build. These cloud-based GNode actors are what make devices
*transactive* - each AtomicTNode is dedicated to the job of operating its very own
`Transactive Device <https://gridworks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/transactive-device.html>`_, and simultaneously bidding on its behalf into electricity markets.
